# Title: student lifestyle dataset, Daily Lifestyle and Academic Performance of Students #
Describe a research scenario and specify a research question based on data analytic methods that we learned in class.
For example, methods such as one and two sample mean tests, correlation tests, simple and multiple linear regression, ANOVA and ANCOVA, one and two-sample tests 
for proportions, and logistic regression are fair game. Perform your analysis, and then report your results and conclusions.
This project has two parts, first original dataset including both scalar and ordinal categorical variables, and then with no ordinal categorical variable.
